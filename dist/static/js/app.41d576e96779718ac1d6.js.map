On this day trip you will travel to the beautiful waters off the coast of the island for swimming and snorkeling. Marvelous sights of giant clams, families of tropical fish, and other beautiful ocean life are common amongst the coral reefs. You will also have the option of dipping into the volcano mud baths of Pulau Tiga, which are located just a 20-minute hike inland from the island’s shore, and offer a fun experience said to be good for the skin. Be sure to bring footwear that you won’t mind getting muddy if you opt for the hike.'\n        };\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  data: function data() {\n    return {};\n  },\n\n  computed: {\n    points: function points() {\n      var array = [];\n      for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n        var res = this.resData.difficulties - i;\n        if (res > 0) {\n          if (res < 1) {\n            // if res have 0.5 point\n            array[i] = 0.5;\n          } else {\n            array[i] = 1;\n          }\n        } else {\n          array[i] = 0;\n        }\n      }\n      return array;\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"dg1k\":\n/***/ (function(module, __webpack_exports__, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\"use strict\";\nvar render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"image-divider\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"image-bg\"},[_c('img',{attrs:{\"src\":_vm.imageSrc}})]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('div',{staticClass:\"overlay-info-wrapper px-4 px-md-0\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"content-wrapper\"},[(_vm.infoTitle)?_c('h3',[_vm._v(_vm._s(_vm.infoTitle))]):_vm._e(),_vm._v(\" \"),(_vm.infoParagraph)?_c('p',[_vm._v(_vm._s(_vm.infoParagraph))]):_vm._e()]),_vm._v(\" \"),(_vm.buttonPath)?_c('router-link',{staticClass:\"btn btn-border\",attrs:{\"to\":_vm.buttonPath}},[_vm._v(_vm._s(_vm.buttonText))]):_vm._e()],1)])}\nvar staticRenderFns = []\nvar esExports = { render: render, staticRenderFns: staticRenderFns }\n/* harmony default export */ __webpack_exports__[\"a\"] = (esExports);\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"dq31\":\n/***/ (function(module, __webpack_exports__, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\"use strict\";\n/* harmony import */ var __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__babel_loader_vue_loader_lib_selector_type_script_index_0_Vuetable_vue__ = __webpack_require__(\"kl3E\");\n/* harmony import */ var __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__vue_loader_lib_template_compiler_index_id_data_v_0378eb9c_hasScoped_true_transformToRequire_video_src_source_src_img_src_image_xlink_href_buble_transforms_vue_loader_lib_selector_type_template_index_0_Vuetable_vue__ = __webpack_require__(\"97ge\");\nfunction injectStyle (ssrContext) {\n  __webpack_require__(\"oV1W\")\n}\nvar normalizeComponent = __webpack_require__(\"VU/8\")\n/* script */\n\n/* template */\n\n/* template functional */\nvar __vue_template_functional__ = false\n/* styles */\nvar __vue_styles__ = injectStyle\n/* scopeId */\nvar __vue_scopeId__ = \"data-v-0378eb9c\"\n/* moduleIdentifier (server only) */\nvar __vue_module_identifier__ = null\nvar Component = normalizeComponent(\n  __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__babel_loader_vue_loader_lib_selector_type_script_index_0_Vuetable_vue__[\"a\" /* default */],\n  __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__vue_loader_lib_template_compiler_index_id_data_v_0378eb9c_hasScoped_true_transformToRequire_video_src_source_src_img_src_image_xlink_href_buble_transforms_vue_loader_lib_selector_type_template_index_0_Vuetable_vue__[\"a\" /* default */],\n  __vue_template_functional__,\n  __vue_styles__,\n  __vue_scopeId__,\n  __vue_module_identifier__\n)\n\n/* harmony default export */ __webpack_exports__[\"a\"] = (Component.exports);\n\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"eQgx\":\n/***/ (function(module, __webpack_exports__, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\"use strict\";\nvar render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"container\",attrs:{\"id\":\"contact\"}},[_c('section',{staticClass:\"padding-of-section mt-5\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"row\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"col-xs-12\"},[_c('content-title',{attrs:{\"contentTitle\":_vm.$t('pages.contact.pageTitle')}}),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('content-paragraph')],1)])]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('section',{staticClass:\"padding-of-section my-sm-5 my-0\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"row\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"col-xs-12\"},[_c('img',{attrs:{\"src\":_vm.mapSrc}})])])]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('section',{staticClass:\"padding-of-section my-5 border-bottom\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"row\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"col-xs-12\"},[_c('content-title',{attrs:{\"contentTitle\":_vm.secondTitle}}),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Tempurong Golden Beach is located approximately two hours away from Kota Kinabalu International Airport (BKI) by car.

locationIntro: 'Over 400 years ago, there was a devastating drought in the area. Villagers were directed to dig a well in a location that was thought to have a water source underground. The villagers tasked with digging the well were skeptical, but with little choice they kept digging anyways. Amazingly, the well they dug was able to provide enough water for the whole village for a long time to come. The water was known to have healing properties, so when elders fell ill, they would bathe in and drink from the well.
