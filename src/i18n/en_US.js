          question: 'Why am I being charged a “tourism tax”?',
          answer: 'Beginning on September 1, 2017, the Government of Malaysia now requires hotel guests that are not Malaysian citizens or long-term/permanent residents of Malaysia to be levied a tourism tax of 10 RM per room per night stay. Please be prepared to pay the additional taxes during checkout (at this time we can only accept cash on site).'
        },
        {
          question: 'Is this resort kid-friendly?',
          answer: 'Absolutely. Of course, do keep an eye on them but our property is relatively small, flat and covered in grass or powdery sand.<br><br> When making your reservation, you will be able to list how many adults and how many children will be in your party. Children are considered ages 3-11, while infants that are 2 years old and below are free.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What should I bring?',
          answer: 'Be sure to bring sun screen, bug repellent, bathing suit and your camera.'
        },
        {
          question: 'When is the best time to visit?',
          answer: 'In general, Kota Kinabalu and Sabah in general is lush and tropical, so a fair amount of rain can be expected all year round, but it’s not usually an all-day affair. The “best time” to visit is from January to March because the climate is relatively cooler and drier.<br><br>October is usually wetter, however weather patterns have been changing in recent years so you can often still have very clear days (as in 2017). May and April are extremely humid and hot, so be prepared and plan a visit to swim around the islands or up to the cooler mountains!'
        },
        {
          question: 'How do I get to your resort?',
          answer: 'You can get here by bus or car, though it is much easier by car! We are happy to pick up and drop off from Kota Kinabalu Airport (BKI) or from Kota Kinabalu City for an additional service charge. You can find specific instructions HERE (link).'
        },
        {
          question: 'What is there to do there?',
          answer: 'As much or as little as you’d like!<br><br>Some come to decompress and escape from the city. For this we have hammocks and a long stretch of beach where you can enjoy the beauty and sounds of Mother Nature. There are also some local sights and neighboring beaches to wander through. We enjoy feeding our guests and have them enjoy all the locally grown and caught foods we have to offer. We also love to set up sunset dinners where you can enjoys all these things at once!<br><br>We enjoy feeding our guests and have them enjoy all the locally grown and caught foods we have to offer.

          question: 'Do you have wifi?',
          answer: 'There is no wifi or television - we do have air conditioning and hot showers, though! Enjoy being unplugged for a bit and have a bit of a digital detox.<br><br>If you’re really desperate, make sure to grab a Malaysian sim card in the city; we receive a data signal so you’re still able to post all those Instaworthy photos.'

        },
        {
          question: 'Why can’t I pay for everything on the website?',
          answer: 'The website is built to collect payment of basic room bookings (as it’s quite straight-forward), however additional meals or tour packages are dependent on many factors so it’s much better for both sides to arrange directly. This also allows us to get to know you and your preferences so that we can create the perfect experience for you and your party.<br><br>Also, by legal requirement, we have to check if you have a Malaysian passport in order to waive the 10% tourism tax, so this is also easier to settled in cash at the resort. This fee and any outstanding costs for extra mattresses, meals and tour packages will be settled in cash at the resort, so please come prepared as there are no ATMs on this side of paradise!'
