      areaIntro: 'Tempurong Golden Beach Resort is located at Tempurung Beach, about 15 Kilometres away from the town of Kuala Penyu, Sabah (about 2 hours from Kota Kinabalu Airport). The village was named about 200 years ago when local villagers found a coconut shell on the beach engraved with holy verses of the Quran, inspiring the name “Tempurung,” translating to “coconut shell” in Malay. The villagers believed that by naming the village after that coconut, God would grant good health and prosperity to the people.',

The “best time” to visit is from January to March because the climate is relatively cooler and drier.<br><br>October is usually wetter, however weather patterns have been changing in recent years so you can often still have very clear days. May and April are very humid and hot, so be prepared and plan a visit to swim around the islands or up to the cooler mountains!',
