      area: 'The Area: Kuala Penyu,<br>Sabah',
      areaIntro: 'Tempurong Golden Beach Resort is located at Tempurung Beach, about 15 Kilometres away from the town of Kuala Penyu, Sabah (about 2 hours from Kota Kinabalu Airport). The village was named about 200 years ago when local villagers found a coconut shell on the beach engraved with holy verses of the Quran, inspiring the name “Tempurung,” translating to “coconut shell” in Malay. The villagers believed that by naming the village after that coconut, God would grant good health and prosperity to the people.',
      turtle: 'Baby Sea Turtle Hatchlings',
      turtleIntro: 'From the end of November through March (and sometimes even through May, depending on the sea tides), you might be lucky to see baby sea turtles hatch (Mother Nature makes no guarantees!). Turtles will dig their nest and lay up to one hundred eggs, after which the mother turtle returns to the ocean. After incubating for about 45-50 days, the eggs hatch, resulting in a miraculous sight of baby sea turtles instinctively returning to the ocean.<br><br>This area is very special to be blessed with turtles coming back to lay their precious eggs on our beaches. We have had research teams stay with us for prolonged periods to study these wonderful creatures so if you are interested in this area of research, please don’t hesitate to reach out. We will be more than happy to collaborate as we care very much for our environment and the wildlife associated.',
      weather: 'Weather',
      weatherIntro: 'In general, Kota Kinabalu and Sabah in general is lush and tropical, so a fair amount of rain can be expected all year round, but it’s not usually an all-day affair. The “best time” to visit is from January to March because the climate is relatively cooler and drier.<br><br>October is usually wetter, however weather patterns have been changing in recent years so you can often still have very clear days. May and April are very humid and hot, so be prepared and plan a visit to swim around the islands or up to the cooler mountains!',
