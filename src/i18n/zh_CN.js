      areaIntro: '等不容金沙龙虾湾度假酒店位于Tempurung等不容海滩，距沙巴Kuala Penyu瓜拉奔优镇约15公里（距哥打京那巴鲁机场约2小时车程）。大约200年前，当地村民在海滩上发现了一块刻有“古兰经”圣经的椰子壳，名为“Tempurung”，马来语为“椰子壳”。村民们相信，通过将椰子命名为村庄，上帝会给人们以健康和繁荣。',

      turtleIntro: '从十一月底到三月（有时甚至五月份以海上潮汐而定），你可能很幸运地看到婴儿海龟孵化（大自然生态没有百分百保证！）。海龟会挖他们的巢穴，然后会下大约一百个蛋，然后母龟就会回到海里。在孵化了大约四十五到五十天之后，卵子孵化出来，婴儿海龟的自然本能既是努力地往海的方向奔爬。目的是投奔大海，返回海洋。<br><br>这个地区是非常特殊的，有乌龟回来在我们的海滩上下宝贝蛋。我们有研究团队长期陪伴我们研究这些奇妙的生物，所以如果你对这个领域的研究感兴趣，请不要犹豫，伸出手。我们将非常乐意合作，因为我们非常关心我们的环境和野生动植物。',

      weatherIntro: '一般来说，哥打京那巴鲁和沙巴总体来说是郁郁葱葱，热带气候，所以一年四季都会有相当数量的降雨，但通常不是全天候的事情。一月到三月的“最佳时间”是因为气候比较凉爽和干燥。<br><br>10月份通常比较潮湿，但是近年来气候模式一直在变化，所以你通常可以有很清楚的日子。五月和四月是非常潮湿和炎热的，所以要做好准备，并计划游览周围的岛屿或到凉爽的山脉上！',

          question: 'Why am I being charged a “tourism tax”?',
          answer: 'Beginning on September 1, 2017, the Government of Malaysia now requires hotel guests that are not Malaysian citizens or long-term/permanent residents of Malaysia to be levied a tourism tax of 10 RM per room per night stay. Please be prepared to pay the additional taxes during checkout (at this time we can only accept cash on site).'
        },
        {
          question: 'Is this resort kid-friendly?',
          answer: 'Absolutely. Of course, do keep an eye on them but our property is relatively small, flat and covered in grass or powdery sand.<br><br> When making your reservation, you will be able to list how many adults and how many children will be in your party. Children are considered ages 3-11, while infants that are 2 years old and below are free.'

          question: 'What should I bring?',
          answer: 'Be sure to bring sun screen, bug repellent, bathing suit and your camera.'
        },
        {
          question: 'When is the best time to visit?',
          answer: 'In general, Kota Kinabalu and Sabah in general is lush and tropical, so a fair amount of rain can be expected all year round, but it’s not usually an all-day affair. The “best time” to visit is from January to March because the climate is relatively cooler and drier.<br><br>October is usually wetter, however weather patterns have been changing in recent years so you can often still have very clear days (as in 2017). May and April are extremely humid and hot, so be prepared and plan a visit to swim around the islands or up to the cooler mountains!'
        },
        {
          question: 'How do I get to your resort?',
          answer: 'You can get here by bus or car, though it is much easier by car! We are happy to pick up and drop off from Kota Kinabalu Airport (BKI) or from Kota Kinabalu City for an additional service charge. You can find specific instructions HERE (link).'

          question: 'What is there to do there?',
          answer: 'As much or as little as you’d like!<br><br>Some come to decompress and escape from the city. For this we have hammocks and a long stretch of beach where you can enjoy the beauty and sounds of Mother Nature. There are also some local sights and neighboring beaches to wander through. We enjoy feeding our guests and have them enjoy all the locally grown and caught foods we have to offer. We also love to set up sunset dinners where you can enjoys all these things at once!<br><br>We enjoy feeding our guests and have them enjoy all the locally grown and caught foods we have to offer.

        },
        {
          question: 'Why can’t I pay for everything on the website?',
          answer: 'The website is built to collect payment of basic room bookings (as it’s quite straight-forward), however additional meals or tour packages are dependent on many factors so it’s much better for both sides to arrange directly. This also allows us to get to know you and your preferences so that we can create the perfect experience for you and your party.<br><br>Also, by legal requirement, we have to check if you have a Malaysian passport in order to waive the 10% tourism tax, so this is also easier to settled in cash at the resort. This fee and any outstanding costs for extra mattresses, meals and tour packages will be settled in cash at the resort, so please come prepared as there are no ATMs on this side of paradise!'
