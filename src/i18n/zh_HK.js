      areaIntro: '等不容金沙龍蝦灣度假酒店位於Tempurung等不容海灘，距沙巴Kuala Penyu瓜拉奔優鎮約15公裡（距哥打京那巴魯機場約2小時車程）。大約200年前，當地村民在海灘上發現了一塊刻有“古蘭經”聖經的椰子殼，名為“Tempurung”，馬來語為“椰子殼”。村民們相信，通過將椰子命名為村莊，上帝會給人們以健康和繁榮。',

      turtleIntro: '從十一月底到三月（有時甚至五月份以海上潮汐而定），你可能很幸運地看到嬰兒海龜孵化（大自然生態沒有百分百保證！）。海龜會挖他們的巢穴，然後會下大約一百個蛋，然後母龜就會回到海裡。在孵化了大約四十五到五十天之後，卵子孵化出來，嬰兒海龜的自然本能既是努力地往海的方向奔爬。目的是投奔大海，返回海洋。<br><br>這個地區是非常特殊的，有烏龜回來在我們的海灘上下寶貝蛋。我們有研究團隊長期陪伴我們研究這些奇妙的生物，所以如果你對這個領域的研究感興趣，請不要猶豫，伸出手。我們將非常樂意合作，因為我們非常關心我們的環境和野生動植物。',

      weatherIntro: '一般來說，哥打京那巴魯和沙巴總體來說是郁郁蔥蔥，熱帶氣候，所以一年四季都會有相當數量的降雨，但通常不是全天候的事情。一月到三月的“最佳時間”是因為氣候比較涼爽和干燥。<br><br>10月份通常比較潮濕，但是近年來氣候模式一直在變化，所以你通常可以有很清楚的日子。五月和四月是非常潮濕和炎熱的，所以要做好准備，並計劃游覽周圍的島嶼或到涼爽的山脈上！',

          question: 'Why am I being charged a “tourism tax”?',
          answer: 'Beginning on September 1, 2017, the Government of Malaysia now requires hotel guests that are not Malaysian citizens or long-term/permanent residents of Malaysia to be levied a tourism tax of 10 RM per room per night stay. Please be prepared to pay the additional taxes during checkout (at this time we can only accept cash on site).'
        },
        {
          question: 'Is this resort kid-friendly?',
          answer: 'Absolutely. Of course, do keep an eye on them but our property is relatively small, flat and covered in grass or powdery sand.<br><br> When making your reservation, you will be able to list how many adults and how many children will be in your party. Children are considered ages 3-11, while infants that are 2 years old and below are free.'

          question: 'What should I bring?',

        },
        {
          question: 'When is the best time to visit?',
          answer: 'In general, Kota Kinabalu and Sabah in general is lush and tropical, so a fair amount of rain can be expected all year round, but it’s not usually an all-day affair. The “best time” to visit is from January to March because the climate is relatively cooler and drier.<br><br>October is usually wetter, however weather patterns have been changing in recent years so you can often still have very clear days (as in 2017). May and April are extremely humid and hot, so be prepared and plan a visit to swim around the islands or up to the cooler mountains!'
        },
        {
          question: 'How do I get to your resort?',
          answer: 'You can get here by bus or car, though it is much easier by car! We are happy to pick up and drop off from Kota Kinabalu Airport (BKI) or from Kota Kinabalu City for an additional service charge. You can find specific instructions HERE (link).'

          question: 'What is there to do there?',
          answer: 'As much or as little as you’d like!<br><br>Some come to decompress and escape from the city. For this we have hammocks and a long stretch of beach where you can enjoy the beauty and sounds of Mother Nature. There are also some local sights and neighboring beaches to wander through. We enjoy feeding our guests and have them enjoy all the locally grown and caught foods we have to offer. We also love to set up sunset dinners where you can enjoys all these things at once!<br><br>We enjoy feeding our guests and have them enjoy all the locally grown and caught foods we have to offer.

          question: 'Why can’t I pay for everything on the website?',
          answer: 'The website is built to collect payment of basic room bookings (as it’s quite straight-forward), however additional meals or tour packages are dependent on many factors so it’s much better for both sides to arrange directly. This also allows us to get to know you and your preferences so that we can create the perfect experience for you and your party.<br><br>Also, by legal requirement, we have to check if you have a Malaysian passport in order to waive the 10% tourism tax, so this is also easier to settled in cash at the resort. This fee and any outstanding costs for extra mattresses, meals and tour packages will be settled in cash at the resort, so please come prepared as there are no ATMs on this side of paradise!'
