					<h3>Tempurong Golden Beach Resort,<br>Kuala Penyu</h3>
					<p>
						Tempurong Golden Beach Resort is located at Tempurong Beach (or Pantai Tempurung) about 15 Kilometres away from Kuala Penyu town.</p>
					<p>
						Tempurung means Coconut Shell in Malay. About 200 years ago, the villagers found a coconut shell engraved with holy verses of the Al-Quran on the beach, so they renamed this village from Tanah Merah to Tempurung. The villager believe the new name "Tempurong" will bring good health and good wealth to the village itself.</p>

                    <h3>Weather</h3>
                    <p>
                        In general, Kota Kinabalu and Sabah in general is lush and tropical, so a fair amount of rain can be expected all year round, but it’s not usually an all-day affair. The “best time” to visit is from January to March because the climate is relatively cooler and drier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        October is usually wetter, however weather patterns have been changing in recent years so you can often still have very clear days (as in 2017). May and April are extremely humid and hot, so be prepared and plan a visit to swim around the islands or up to the cooler mountains!
                    </p>

                    <h3>Dry Season</h3>
                    <p>
                        November to March and May to September are generally considered the “dry season”, with June being the driest. May and April are extremely humid and hot, so be prepared with sunscreen, sunglasses and a hat to protect yourself, and plan a visit to swim around the islands or up to the cooler mountains!
                    </p>

                    <h3>Wet Season</h3>
                    <p>
                        April, May, and November tend to be rainier but usually in the early morning and late afternoon, meaning that you can enjoy a pleasant and cooler period for part of the day. October is usually wetter, however weather patterns have been changing in recent years so you can often still have very clear days (as in 2017).

			<!--<p>-->
			<!--Once upon a time, a beautiful hardworking girl with kind hearted named Aisha. This charming Aisha is admired by many young admirers. However, she fell in love with a handsome guy John of another village. Both lovers are not blessed by their own village. They were chased and escaped until they reached the spiritual tree to seek for help from the fairies. One of the fairies direct them to the space rock at Batu Luang Beach.</p>-->
			<!--<p>-->
			<!--When they arrived, they met Puteri Raja Alam who is the Princess of King of Nature. Their love touched the fairy who gave her compassionate to help them under one condition. They will never see their family again. Watching the people from both villages reaching the space rock by far, they amicably make the promise.
